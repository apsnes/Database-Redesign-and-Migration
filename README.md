# Mini T-SQL Database Migration Project

This project involves migrating data from a poorly designed database to a more efficient, normalized structure adhering to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** principles. The new design incorporates improved relationships, including the implementation of **many-to-many relationships** using junction tables.
